Not the same dream, always ended differently with different events but always started with the same figure. Let me paint the picture here first. My bedroom window looked out on to a culdersac at the top of a very steep hill. It was lit by one street lamp. If you looked out into it at night, culdersac would be lit but it's entry would plunge off into oblivion. So from my window every night, I could see what looked like (to me) the poster from The Exorcist.  Now, the dream would always start the same. I'd be sleeping, and wake up to the faint incoming tune from beyond the hill. I would hear this tune grow as the figure of my nightmares would make it's way, lumbering up the hill. The tune was some sort of low double bass Looney Tunes or Tom &amp; Jerry number I can never find the name of. The figure? Sweetums from The Muppets. He would dance/lumber up into the light of the culdersac and I would immediately try to hide under the covers or bed or in the closet, nothing ever worked. I'd always hear him coming into the house and then down the hallway, into my room where he would proceed to violently fling me against shit until I was broken and laid their bleeding before finally putting me out of my misery and crushing my head. Often either with his foot, something nearby or by just biting down.  Over the years the dream varied as I learned to run and hide and escape into different areas of the house but everything always ended the same. One of the most messed up scenarios once was when he had two dogs, big white wolves actually. He sicked them on me and that went just swimmingly. Another time he possessed my family and turned them all into red eyed catatonics who if I approached them they'd open their mouths wide as a snakes and reveal their teeth and tongue (looked like the mouth of a freaking deep sea angler fish), horrifying.  The last time I dreamed about Sweetums though was the most interesting...  The dream started the same way it always did. The impending music, Sweetums lumbering into the light of the culdersac, but this time I didn't hide. I didn't even leave my room. In fact I just sat there, waiting, watching the door for Sweetums. And as the music got to it's usual loud state with his proximity he stopped in the door way and just stared at me. Me at him and him back at me. For the first time ever he spoke, in my Dad's voice... Well done. I'm proud of you. Then he walked away.  I've never seen him since... 7 years of recurring nightmares at it ends with that.",t3_34ffhl

There is always a door at the bottom. It slowly creeks open and a giant hissing crocodile emerges. I try to scramble up the stairs and keep tripping and falling the whole way up. I finally get to the top and collapse and my legs wont work. I try to scream for help but nothing comes out, all while this croc slowly gets closer and closer. Eventually it gets to me and eats me.  - This one the context of the dream is always different except for 1 detail it always takes place in the mountains. I could be riding a bike, in the city in the middle of a car chase, or in a park with some girl I wanna bang. Then out of nowhere a giant meteorite impacts the side of a mountain nearby and huge chunk of the mountain gets blown off and flies towards me. It is always so vivid and real. So this chunk is massive and I know there is nothing I can do but just watch it fly towards me. Right before it impacts I wake up.  I forgot about a sleep paralysis dream I get. Not as common as the other 2, I get it maybe 3 times a year. I will be lying in bed and then I wake up (at least I think I do) but I cant move a single muscle. The only thing that functions is my eyes. Then a black cat with glowing eyes will jump up onto the foot of the bed start hissing at and screeching at me while it slowly crawls up my body towards my face. I will try and kick and scream but nothing works. Its much like the Crocodile dream except I can see and sense everything going on around me. my girlfriend has even been watching TV beside me while it happens and looked at me and asked whats wrong with me? while I stare into space not blinking or moving. And I can see her and hear her but cant respond. eventually the cat gets to my stomach, crouches low lets out a hiss and pounces at my throat. As its mid leap it just turns to smoke and disappears. The second it disappears I can move and scream, and I do every time.... The weird part is everything stays the same its like the only thing that was dream was the cat that was put into the real world that I see in front of me. ",t3_34ffhl

I want to eliminate them off my list of things which are or are not possible.  I started having a thought about a year ago.   I came to the stunning realization that I'm the only thing in existence that can feel any way about me.   That didn't change that fact that outside influences had an effect on my feelings, but to really realize that was pretty important I think.  Even when others judge you, it's your feelings that make you feel what you feel.   Also, that feeling you described about feeling bad, and Not worthy, those are bang on.   Because I've realized that I feel very uncomfortable around innocence.   Around babies/children, dogs, really kind people, family....etc.  I am naturally attracted to dark things, those things interest me more than positive light things, and that's supposed to be bad and negative.    My idea of heaven is not white and bright things and perfectly clean clothing, it's carnivals and fun houses, and fast cars and tunnels that lead to alternate dimensions and entertainment (basically Earth minus the shit I don't like)....etc.   I've always wondered if that is spiritual, or psychological, or if they are one and the same.  I've heard it's kind of common to be afraid of children, but I think it's weird.   I guess i'm into some stuff that most would consider kind of shameful, and I know that if they knew they'd feel differently about me.  Only my closest friend knows about one of them, and I am very fortunate that he is alright knowing it.  The way I feel, is beyond my control though...But one can feel like a dud, when comparing themselves to the status quo or general ideas about what constitutes a good soul, or a corrupt damaged one.  it's natural I guess.

For all intensive purposes I think you are wrong. In an age where false morals are a diamond dozen, true virtues are a blessing in the skies, and are more than just ice king on the cake. We often put our false morality on a petal stool like a bunch of pre-Madonnas, but you all seem to be taking something very valuable for granite. So I ask of you to mustard up all the strength you can because it is a doggy dog world out there. Although there is some merit to what you are saying it seems like you have a huge ship on your shoulder. In your argument you seem to throw everything in but the kids Nsync, and even though you are having a feel day with this I am here to bring you back into reality. I have a sick sense when it comes to these types of things. It is almost spooky, because I cannot turn a blonde eye to these glaring flaws in your rhetoric. I have zero taller ants when it comes to people spouting out hate in the name of moral righteousness. You just need to remember what comes around is all around, and when supply and command fails you will be the first to go. Make my words, when you get down to brass stacks it doesn't take rocket appliances to get two birds stoned at once. It's clear who makes the pants in this relationship, and sometimes you just have to swallow your prize and accept the fax, instead of making a half-harded effort.

Then, I wake up and continue to feel awful and guilty about the dream and how convinced I was of what's happening.  I don't know why these happen. I never have cheated on anyone, and I don't plan to. I think it stems from a distrust of myself, distrust of self control, and fear of how I would react to myself if I were to cheat on someone.

Honestly, for most thinking people, there needs to be an actual reason for a change in the laws (especially those mandated by God), but I can't see why any rule against gay sex then would be less applicable now.  Seriously, why would god say that homosexuals should be executed?  Why was that okay back then, but not now?  As for Hate the sin. Love the sinner, it's like saying I still love you, but I hate a thing that you do that is (likely) closely tied with a major part of your identity.

I believe you that you haven't heard it, although I have definitely heard it.  And among the general public this is said almost constantly.  If you're looking for me to go combing through 30+ years of various politicians' speeches and remarks, I'll just be honest: I'm not doing that for the sake of a random internet discussion.  If you think it's worth digging, be my guest. [**EDIT**: although see my comment [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/34ffo5/what_one_sentence_can_someone_say_to_make_you/cqulldd) for a couple of examples that I found without trouble.]  The point is that is that it's not as if people haven't heard this message.  That message is there.  MY point is that addressing these things you list, just by themselves, are not *enough*.  And it's far more complicated than don't have kids.  Birth control is a pretty significant factor, and on that score it's not even as simple as don't have sex.   Maybe you've gotten the impression that liberals are a-okay with all those problems.  They're not, at all.  The difference is that (some) liberals recognize them as symptoms of broader issues.  And many of those broader issues are the result of long term policies which were put in place or are maintained out of racism.  That's the legacy people are always going on about.  So what's wrong with addressing those problems, too?  My concern here is that you seem to be saying those other things don't exist.   Now, our disagreement *should be* over how to address these systemic issues.  As a conservative, I'm sure you're against government programs that attempt to tackle poverty (and depending on the program, I might be too).  But I should think that you'd support means of ensuring more sensible sentencing, of reforming police departments whose behavior lead to eruptions like Baltimore and Ferguson and so on, etc.  ",t1_cque5i1

It usually happens about once a year, and for the life of me can't really explain why but I'll do my best.  I start out in what seems to be the Amazon, like the trees and rivers. But they are Islands similar to the floating ones in Avatar. (I was having these dreams before the films but they are the closest thing visually) .Except the river is very straight, canal like. I'm floating down it as it gets faster and faster. I'm joined but random people I can't recognise, but they are floating down with me. There is no visible floating device. The river is straight but the trees and vines turn around me. Soon this ride takes me off the edge into the longest drop I ever seen. Its an almost perfect circle down, I can see other straight rivers entering from the sides. I fall down, I keep falling for a while. Then fade I to black, when I wake up, I'm wet and I'm down a street. The but there is only 3 houses I see, I'm encapsulated in a box, the blue walls go all around with room to spare. I get out of the gutter and walk to the first house in front of me. I peer through the window. There is a family inside, all happy, like Christmas dinner time. But not, one of the older children turn to look at the window and they see me. She screams, the while family looks over and they start panicking. I get worried and jump back, looking around. There is a mirror just floating between the house. I stand in front of it and look. I can't describe what I see, but it brings me to tears instantly. I cry desperately to this mirror, sobbing into my limbs (sometimes hands, othertimes tentacles, once wood). I sit down on the curb outside these 3 houses still crying where the youngest child comes over to me and puts a hand on my shoulder. At this point, it feels like the camera ending as I can see the child resting the hand on the thing and I pan up into the darkness where I wake up.  I don't know why I have this dream, it happened once to twice a year for majority of my life, not had it for 2 years but it sticks with me still.",t3_34ffhl

Next morning, dropped $5k on a diamond, drove 800 kms in 7.5 hours to show up, kneeling, on her doorstep in the rain on a cold winter's night...  She said no.  ...............  Here's a cool dumb story. I was doing a Viking combat display for the National Maritime Museum in Sydney. Threw my shield at my opponent, who responded by reaching out and hitting my now exposed, unarmoured hand, and severed my left index finger. I was then taken into a nearby corporate lobby where I bled copiously over expensive Italian leather couches, then on to RPA hospital where I was the first sword related injury in over 100 years. Only part of the incident I remember is looking at where my finger was now hanging by a single tendon, seeing the bone and spurting blood, and saying,  That'll need stitches.  My next clear memory is of sitting in the A+E waiting room oh the RPA with a bunch of other fully armed and armoured Vikings.
